I'm Kyle Rokita. I started my professional life as an actuary, but now work as a software developer.

Why software development? I like solving problems and software development provides an abundance of problems that need solving! I also enjoy a certain degree of creative thinking. And wearing shorts to work. So yea...software development.

I began my journey using Objective-C and Swift to submit apps to the App Store. Now I am learning JavaScript at Hack Reactor in SF so I can meet a bunch of others with similar aspirations. Queue the bootcamp haters!

I'll be blogging about software development and anything else that I think others might find somewhat interesting or useful.

And finally...GO IRISH!
